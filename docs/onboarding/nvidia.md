# Overview

!!! note

    The process for onboarding NVIDIA organizations will change in the future when we begin provisioning the runners to NVIDIA's GitHub Enterprise account.

    This documentation will be updated accordingly when that happens.

1. Review and install the [`copy-pr-bot`](../apps/copy-pr-bot/index.md) GitHub application
2. Review and install the [`nvidia-runners`](../apps/nvidia-runners/index.md) GitHub application
   - Wait for confirmation from the _GitHub Actions Runners_ team before moving to the final step
3. View the [runners](../runners/index.md) page and start using the self-hosted runners!
