# Overview

!!! note

    At the moment, the process for onboarding both NVIDIA and non-NVIDIA GitHub organizations is the same.

    Therefore, NVIDIA organizations can proceed to the onboarding page for non-NVIDIA organizations [here](./non-nvidia.md).

    The process for onboarding NVIDIA organizations will change in the future when we begin provisioning the runners to NVIDIA's GitHub Enterprise account.

    This documentation will be updated accordingly when that happens.
