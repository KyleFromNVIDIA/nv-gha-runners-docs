# Overview

!!! note

    The process for onboarding NVIDIA organizations will change in the future when we begin provisioning the runners to NVIDIA's GitHub Enterprise account.

    This documentation will be updated accordingly when that happens.

The onboarding steps for NVIDIA GitHub organizations are:

1. Review and install the [`copy-pr-bot`](../apps/copy-pr-bot/index.md) GitHub application
1. Review and install the [`nvidia-runners`](../apps/nvidia-runners/index.md) GitHub application
   - Wait for confirmation from NVIDIA's GitHub Actions team before moving to the final step
1. View the [runners](../runners/index.md) page and start using the self-hosted runners!
